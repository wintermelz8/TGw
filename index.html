      <h3>Oh, hello there &#128522;</h3>
      <p>Thank you for visiting. I don't intent to make a long introduction here as it would be a clutter. If you want to know more about <span class="web-name">That Girl write</span>, you can go to the <a href="about.html#bio">about</a> page.</p>
      <p>Ah, I see I forgot to introduce myself! Pardon me... you can refer me as Windah. I am the owner of <span class="web-name">That Girl</span>. It's an honour to meet you. Whoever you are, I appreciate your visit. You can come back to <span class="web-name">TGw</span> anytime if you love to read relatable story which I will upload sometimes, informative blogs, original poems or perhaps to enter the <span class="web-name">TGs (That Girl's space)</span>. I hope that helps you relax from your stresses for a while.</p><br><br><br>
      <h2><center>Hey, by the way, I'll present you with a story, which will officially open the first book of <span class="web-name">TGw</span>, <span class="web-story">dandelion</span>.</center></h2><br><br><br><br>
      <h3>Let it go, self.</h3><br>
      <p>Heaving breath has never been as heavy as today. Living itself has been a challenge. I always wanted that feeling of lightness -- the feeling of having wings or perhaps, floating. I envy those dandelions -- carried away by the wind when the time is right and be reborn after travelling into the unknown, random place.</p>
      <p>The way it just let itself detached from its trunk and went with the wind makes me wish I was a dandelion. You know, the feeling of wanting to escape from where you're in. Well, I just wanted something new. I needed to let go what's bringing me down to fly.</p><br>
      <p>As I begin to feel the wind,  I picked up a dandelion and blow it. Then I whispered to the wind as I watch it fly high to the free air, "goodbye, everyone".</p><br>
      <p>To be continued...</p>
